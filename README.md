## About

This repository contains the decrypted and decompressed contents of the `eqgrp-free-file.tar.xz` file released by "The Shadow Brokers". The contents are supposedly a free sample of the files exfiltrated from the [Equation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group), a notorious, highly-sophisticated cyber attack group.

The Shadow Brokers have opened an auction to sell off the remaining files, although the legitimacy of the auction is widely disputed. 


## Disclaimers

This repository is provided as an educational resource to researchers wanting to validate the claims of the Shadow Brokers, as well as anyone wanting to study code potentially originating from a powerful threat actor. Needless to say, this repository may contain extremely malicious code, and I (@nneonneo) disclaim any responsibility for what may happen with your use or misuse of this software.

The code does *not* belong to me, but the author of the code is unknown and is very unlikely to step up to enforce any copyright claims. Nevertheless, if takedown is warranted I will gladly remove the repository.

Auction Instructions
- ——————–
We auction best files to highest bidder. Auction files better than stuxnet. Auction files better than free files we already give you. The party which sends most bitcoins to address: 19BY2XCgbDe6WtTVbTyzM9eR3LYr6VitWK before bidding stops is winner, we tell how to decrypt. Very important!!! When you send bitcoin you add additional output to transaction. You add OP_Return output. In Op_Return output you put your (bidder) contact info. We suggest use bitmessage or I2P-bote email address. No other information will be disclosed by us publicly. Do not believe unsigned messages. We will contact winner with decryption instructions. Winner can do with files as they please, we not release files to public.

Closing Remarks
- ————————————————–

!!! Attention Wealthy Elites !!!

We have final message for “Wealthy Elites”. We know what is wealthy but what is Elites? Elites is making laws protect self and friends, lie and fuck other peoples. Elites is breaking laws, regular peoples go to jail, life ruin, family ruin, but not Elites. Elites is breaking laws, many peoples know Elites guilty, Elites call top friends at law enforcement and government agencies, offer bribes, make promise future handjobs, (but no blowjobs). Elites top friends announce, no law broken, no crime commit. Reporters (not call journalist) make living say write only nice things about Elites, convince dumb cattle, is just politics, everything is awesome, check out our ads and our prostitutes. Then Elites runs for president. Why run for president when already control country like dictatorship? What this have do with fun Cyber Weapons Auction? We want make sure Wealthy Elite recognizes the danger cyber weapons, this message, our auction, poses to their wealth and control. Let us spell out for Elites. Your wealth and control depends on electronic data. You see what “Equation Group” can do. You see what cryptolockers and stuxnet can do. You see free files we give for free. You see attacks on banks and SWIFT in news. Maybe there is Equation Group version of cryptolocker+stuxnet for banks and financial systems? If Equation Group lose control of cyber weapons, who else lose or find cyber weapons? If electronic data go bye bye where leave Wealthy Elites? Maybe with dumb cattle? “Do you feel in charge?” Wealthy Elites, you send bitcoins, you bid in auction, maybe big advantage for you?
